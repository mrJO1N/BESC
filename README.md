Brainfuck Extended Set of Chars (BESC)

another dialect of an esoteric programming language, but with cardinal differences.

Brainfuck has capabilities only for console applications like a calculator, and my implementation in the future will have GUI capabilities, sound control, multithreading and external connections.

like a Swiss knife - bad opener, bad scissors, bad pliers, but always useful
